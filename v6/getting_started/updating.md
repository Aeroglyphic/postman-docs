### Native Apps

Postman's native apps on MacOS & Windows will notify you whenever an update is available. To force a check, head over to the Update section of the Settings window. If an update is available, you can choose to start the download. You will be notified when the download is complete prompting you to restart the Postman app to apply the updates. If you're not ready to update yet, click **Remind me later** to prompt you again after the next app reload or launch.

### Chrome App

Postman's Chrome app is usually updated automatically. However, we have little visibility into the actual update flow, and Chrome sometimes doesn't update the app for a long time.

The latest version is visible on Postman's webstore listing - [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en][0].

To manually force an update, here's what you need to do:

1. Head to [chrome://extensions][1] in Chrome
2. Enable 'Developer Mode'
3. Click the 'Update extensions now' button
